basically in the django project we work in two fieds , the one i the projext ad the other is the app,

the hello is the project

the home is the app , where we will make all the front end

in the views filw , we will add the files that can be viewed by the User

in the urls of homew we will add all the links
in the urls of the hello we will add all the links so that the urls of  the home can be called by it 


we will create two folders 

1 static  =- this will store asll the static images of he file , it can be viewed by the User
2 templates this folderwill be usaed to satored the templates 

bnow in the settings file of the hello , at the end we will find the static filder link , now read the documentation of it 


the static folder can be seen by the users , so we cannot put sensetive files in this folder


MODELS 

in django we can create models that will be stored in the sql databases
to create it go to the app folder and click on the models'

create the models in the form of class


to add in the database we have to do the following

Django insert data from w3 schools


commands

The manage.py make migrations look for the changes in the files and let it know to the project , it basically looks at the changes made in the app folder of the file

python manage.py migrate = it will look for the tables for authentication , these authentication comes by default

we have to create a createsuperuser comomand to add the username and the password
